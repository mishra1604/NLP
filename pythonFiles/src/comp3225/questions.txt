What money have you got, Copperfield?
Do you want to spend anything now?
And another shilling or so in biscuits, and another in fruit, eh?
What’s this?
Traddles?
Hey?
What’s the report of this boy?
You haven’t got a sister, have you?
Perhaps you’d like to spend a couple of shillings or so, in a bottle of currant wine by and by, up in the bedroom?
Do YOU know me?
Has that fellow’--to the man with the wooden leg--‘been here again?
You’ll be glad to spend another shilling or so, in almond cakes, I dare say?
Not yet?
